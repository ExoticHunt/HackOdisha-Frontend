Our project Rementia is focused on making the lives of people with dementia simpler. Dementia is the loss of cognitive functioning — thinking, remembering, and reasoning — to such an extent that it interferes with a person's daily life and activities. People with dementia often forget to perform day-to-day activities. Even though there are medicines for such condition, medicines are of no use if the person forgets to take them on time. We understand that everyone can not afford to have a person with them all the time to remind them to do tasks. So we have used technology to replace them.
Our website needs people with dementia or their near and dear ones to create a user profile for them. Once registered they can upload their medications with intake time and dose and our website will notify them via e-mail. They can also add tasks to do and we will remind them at the correct time.
People with dementia sometimes forget their identity causing angst to their family and friends. We have made use of machine learning to tackle this issue. If someone finds a dementia patient and wants to help them out they can take a picture of the patient (without having to create a profile for themselves) and make an image search. With our facial recognition technology our application will tell them if the suspected person is a dementia patient or not. If yes, our application will share the patient's basic details so that they can be helped.
This is a live website.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
